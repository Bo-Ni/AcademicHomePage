abstract = "The interaction between cracks and inclusions plays an important role in the fracture behavior of particulate composites. It is commonly recognized that an inclusion stiffer than the matrix tends to deflect an approaching crack away while a softer inclusion attracts the crack. Here, we demonstrate by analytical modeling and numerical simulations that the crack-inclusion interaction can be tuned by an applied T-stress. Under a sufficiently large compressive applied T-stress, cracks can be attracted to stiffer inclusions while repelled by softer ones, thus reversing the conventional trend. Potential applications of this work include composite electrodes in lithium-ion batteries and hydraulic fracturing."
