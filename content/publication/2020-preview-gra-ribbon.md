abstract = "Fracture has been a grave concern for practical applications of graphene and other atomically thin and brittle materials. By contrast, in this issue of Matter, Ming et al. present a method to harness the power of fracture in controlled fabrication of ordered graphene ribbons, which may initiate a new approach to making structures and devices based on two-dimensional (2D) materials."
