"Topological Toughening of Graphene and other 2D Materials", Symposium "Properties of 2D Materials including Electronic, Magnetic, Mechanical, Optical, and Thermal Properties”, AVS 64th International Symposium & Exhibition, Nov 1, 2017, Tampa, FL, USA (Presented by B. Ni)

This four-hour workshop will provide a gentle introduction to machine learning with R using the modern suite of predictive modeling packages called [tidymodels](https://github.com/tidymodels). We will build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models. Along the way, we’ll learn about key concepts in machine learning including overfitting, the holdout method, the bias-variance trade-off, ensembling, cross-validation, and feature engineering. Learners will gain knowledge about good predictive modeling practices, as well as hands-on experience using tidymodels packages like [parsnip](https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip), [rsample](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample), [recipes](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/), [yardstick](https://tidymodels.github.io/yardstick/), [tune](https://tidymodels.github.io/tune/), and [workflows](https://tidymodels.github.io/workflows/).
